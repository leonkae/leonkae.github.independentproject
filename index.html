                        Well isnt that the most dreaded question of the 21st century ? "tell me about yourself" welll i will do my best, my name is <a href="index.html">Andre Leon Kaeulna</a>and my journey to become a developer kicked off long ago in a distant land, well for context not that long and so distant, it actually begun around three years ago and just like most i decided to sort for this skills in the university, for a while it worked, the university background was fun,fresh and different, but after a while it became frustrating the content was slow and i constantly asked myself if i would ever be able to much up to the skills protrayed by my collegues, drum role please, in comes <a href="https://moringaschool.com/" target="blank">MORINGA SCHOOL</a>I discovered about Moringa school through many different sources but the funniest one was word of mouth during a gym workout and if i can remember correctly the conversation went something like "have you heard of moringaschool", que the deep dive into research, i asked the questions,i visted the website, i made the physical visits and after a while i was ready to join and just as i was about to make the move incomes COVID-19 i had to bind my time and a while later here we are. Alot of people tried to talk me out of it but there would be no turning back, i was a man on a mission, no-one really got to hear my reasons, so here goes the answer to the question  why did you decide to take a class on programming? simple? i want to make an impact in various ways one of which includes getting my country men to trust in technology for i believe we could achieve so much with technology integrated to us in a different way, i would also like to be in the room when God Forbid the next big event hits and its time to come up solutions and above all i just love it, because with every single line of code i type it feels like the computer ever so slightly whispers back to me the words "dare to dream," in simple terms why Programming? because i dare to dream.

                        so my name is <a href="index.html">Andre Leon KAEULANA</a>consider the above my origin story, just as the infinite typing carousel didctaes i am Developer (well will be),a designer,a radio host,and a film director, yes the mixture seems weird but my interests are diverse, and as much as i would like to make the masess understand i would just have to quote the famous joker line and say, "you just wouldnt get it." </p>
